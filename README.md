# bootcamp-python-practice

Welcome to my Python practice repository!  
This is where I share my journey of learning Python â€” through small projects, exercises, and experiments.

I'm currently learning full-stack development, this repo helps me apply and reinforce the Python fundamentals I'm learning.  
Here you'll find scripts and mini-projects that cover topics like:

- Variables and data types
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Functions
- Lists, dictionaries, and sets
  
## Goals

- Strengthen my understanding of core Python concepts
- Build confidence in writing clean, readable code
- Prepare for building more complex projects with back-end logic

##  How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x).  
To run any of the files:
